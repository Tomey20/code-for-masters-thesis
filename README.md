# code-for-masters-thesis
This repository contains the code for my Masterâ€™s Thesis, my Master's Thesis paper and the files required to run the code in the respective uploaded files:
Final_script_for_masters_project.R
and
Master's Thesis.pdf
and
GSE217215_201218_ATAC_subsample.rds.gz
and
GSE217215_201218_ATAC_fragments.tsv.gz

The initial file that is being loaded in the script is the unzipped GSE217215_201218_ATAC_subsample.rds file containing (meta)data of hESCs that were transduced with a library of 198 transcription factor ORFs and cultured for 7 days before single-cell ATAC- and RNA-seq joint profiling. The other file GSE217215_201218_ATAC_fragments.tsv.gz is the compressed file that contains the raw scATAC-seq fragments file.
The files are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) with the GEO accession number: GSE217215 and it is from the paper by Joung J, Ma S, Tay T, Geiger-Schuller KR et al. A transcription factor atlas of directed differentiation. Cell 2023 Jan 5;186(1):209-229.e26. PMID: 36608654

Make sure that the paths to these files are appropriatly changed in the script in order to run it.
